## PicoCTF 2019
- ### dont-use-client-side

This Task provide us with [url](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/37821/) Shown a secure login portal

![ducs](img/ducs-1.PNG)

Try to bypass with ``admin' or '1'='1`` but it shows ``Incorrect password``

Found an interesting Code 

```
<script type="text/javascript">
  function verify() {
    checkpass = document.getElementById("pass").value;
    split = 4;
    if (checkpass.substring(0, split) == 'pico') {
      if (checkpass.substring(split*6, split*7) == 'a3c8') {
        if (checkpass.substring(split, split*2) == 'CTF{') {
         if (checkpass.substring(split*4, split*5) == 'ts_p') {
          if (checkpass.substring(split*3, split*4) == 'lien') {
            if (checkpass.substring(split*5, split*6) == 'lz_1') {
              if (checkpass.substring(split*2, split*3) == 'no_c') {
                if (checkpass.substring(split*7, split*8) == '9}') {
                  alert("Password Verified")
                  }
                }
              }
      
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    else {
      alert("Incorrect password");
    }
    
</script>
```
Seeing ``pico`` and ``CTF{`` assuming this is the flag now lets analyze the code.

we can see that the password is being checked in a series of conditions. The password input is broken into multiple parts using the ``substring()`` function, which extracts specific parts of the string, and then compares them to hardcoded values.

The value of ``split`` is set to ``4``, meaning the password is divided into chunks of 4 characters for validation.

the ``verify`` function check password in parts :

1. First 4 Characthers (index 0-4)
- The condition ``checkpass.substring(0, split) == 'pico'`` tells us that the first 4 characters of the password must be ``'pico'``

2. Characters at index 24-28 (6th chunk):

- The condition ``checkpass.substring(split*6, split*7) == 'a3c8'`` checks that the 6th chunk of the password (characters 24-28) must be ``'a3c8'``.

3. Characters at index 4-8 (2nd chunk):

- The condition ``checkpass.substring(split, split*2) == 'CTF{'`` checks that the 2nd chunk of the password (characters 4-8) must be ``'CTF{'``.

4. Characters at index 16-20 (5th chunk):

- The condition ``checkpass.substring(split*4, split*5) == 'ts_p'`` checks that the 5th chunk of the password (characters 16-20) must be ``'ts_p'``.

5. Characters at index 12-16 (4th chunk):

- The condition ``checkpass.substring(split*3, split*4) == 'lien'`` checks that the 4th chunk of the password (characters 12-16) must be ``'lien'``.

6. Characters at index 20-24 (6th chunk):

- The condition ``checkpass.substring(split*5, split*6) == 'lz_1``' checks that the 6th chunk of the password (characters 20-24) must be ``'lz_1'``.

7. Characters at index 8-12 (3rd chunk):

- The condition ``checkpass.substring(split*2, split*3) == 'no_c'`` checks that the 3rd chunk of the password (characters 8-12) must be ``'no_c'``.

8. Last 4 characters (index 28-32):

- The condition ``checkpass.substring(split*7, split*8) == '9}'`` checks that the last chunk of the password (characters 28-32) must be ``'9}'``.

From the conditions we can arrange the password in order from ``0-4`` to ``4-8``and so on then we will get the flag goes like this 

```picoCTF{no_clients_plz_1a3c89}```

- ### logon

In this task we've been given a [url](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/13594/) Shown a login page, 

![logon-1](img/logon-1.PNG)

Got access with this credentials ``admin' or '1'='1`` but it shows ``No flag for you``

![logon-2](img/logon-2.PNG)

Power up your Burpsuite turn on ``intercept`` and direct the our url to ``Repeater``. We got Interesting response here

![logon-3](img/logon-3.PNG)

The response show our username, password that we input earlier and also admin that set to ``False``

```password="admin' or '1'='1"; username="admin' or '1'='1"; admin=False;```

change the admin value to ``True`` then We'll get the Flag

![logon-4](img/logon-4.PNG)

``picoCTF{th3_c0nsp1r4cy_l1v3s_d1c24fef}``

- ### Insp3ct0r

On this simple task We've been given a [url](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/) and a hint that says ``How do you inspect web code on a browser?, There's 3 parts``

That means theres 3 part of Flag that need to assemble together, hmm, Interesting.

<img alt="Insp3ct0r" height="150px" src="img/inspector.PNG">

As the Header of the page says inspect the Web then we'll get our 1st Flag ``<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->``

How about the 2nd and 3rd Flag ? Take note here, rather then just inspect to get flag and view code, we can view file like ``css & js``. Just like this Page they use ``css`` and ``js`` to link and include as external file in HTML Document

View ``mycss.css`` and ``myjs.js`` file then you'll get 2nd and 3rd part of the flag 

``You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t``

``Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?832b0699}``

Assemble all the Flag then you'll get the real Flag : 
`` picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?832b0699}``

- ### where are the robots

Given a [url](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/) with a message ``Where are the robots?``. 

Im assuming ``robots`` that the page mention is ``robots.txt``

#### FYI : ``robots.txt`` is the filename used for implementing the ``Robots Exclusion Protocol``, a standard used by websites to indicate to visiting web crawlers and other web robots which portions of the website they are allowed to visit.

#### Simple Explain : ``robots.txt`` is a file on a website that tells search engines what they can and can't look at. It's like a "do not enter" sign for certain parts of the site. For example, you might block them from seeing private or unnecessary pages. 

The page mention ``Where are the robots?`` means we have to find they file, hmm, Interesting 

Lets use [Dirb](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-dirb-kali-linux/) to search the robot file. Using this command

```dirb https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/ /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt```

We'll get the result after several minutes.

<img alt="robots" height="250px" src="img/robots.PNG">

Open the url you'll see Disallow file named ``/477ce.html``. Open it then you'll see the Flag.

``picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_477ce}``
